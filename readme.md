# The 2022 CTWC Portland Guide

## TRANSPORTATION

TriMet:
All busses, Streetcar, and MAX support apple pay/google pay debit cards. 

2.50/1.25 (see below) gets you a 2 hour pass. If you buy another pass outside the 2 hour window in a single calendar day, you ride free the rest of the day. 

If you want to save 1.25 per ride, download the Hop Fastpass app and make a digital card (5.00 single time fee) and say you’re an honored citizen or a youth. 

Taxis

Portland has a solid taxi system, which can be useful if you’re going to/from the airport and have lots of luggage. Radio Cab is my personal favorite. It can get a bit spendy (I believe it’s around $50 from the airport to the convention center area), and nobody will care if you get on the Max near the airport. 


## FOOD

For cheap food nearby the convention center, there’s a couple of options. There is, of course, the CC Denny’s. However, there is also an Applebees, and a local chain called Burgerville. They’re alright. For higher end food (if you want to see what portland has to offer) check out [Afuri,](https://afuri.us/) [Kachka,](http://www.kachkapdx.com/) and [Danwei Canting.](https://www.danweicanting.com/) 

## SHOPPING

Portland had a lot more shopping before the pandemic. Currently, downtown Portland is a bit… different than you may remember it. Nonetheless, there’s still plenty of places in Southeast to check out! There’s a Nike and an Adidas store downtown, there’s a sort of Japanese Ikea in the same area, and there’s America’s largest bookstore just a few blocks away!

## ACTIVITIES

Portland has no shortage of arcades and pinballs. Most of them will be at the convention, but some major players are not attending this year. The biggest arcade is going to be [Ground Kontrol](https://groundkontrol.com/games/). Alternatively, if you want to check out a museum and have a day free, OMSI is a great place to go. By the time CTWC is happening, the Orca exhibit there is going to be open, and it’s a awesome.
